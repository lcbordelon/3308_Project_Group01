Vision statement: Achieve a fun and exciting game.

Motivation: To build a fun and exciting game. To also build something achievable.

Risks to project completion, possibly including:
learning how the game works
new language or working environment
no prior experience working with these team members
time management with jobs, life, etc.
version control

Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
Each team member will play the Minesweeper game to learn how it works.
Develop pieces of the project as we learn about new languages in class. Meet each week to assist team members with pieces of the project.
Meeting each week.
Open communication and regularly scheduled team meetings.
Division of tasks and communication on which piece of the project each team is working on. When someone pushes an update to the main branch, a different team member will review the merge request.

Development method: scrum, Trello (link below)
