            <h2>About Minesweeper</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Minesweeper! The cutthroat game of chance filled with intrigue, laughs, romance, and most importantly... <strong>bombs!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Minesweeper was created by Microsoft in the 1990s and even for the time it was released it already featured middle of the road graphics. 
            </p>
            <h2>How to play Minesweeper:</h2>
            <p>
                When the gameboard loads you are presented with a grid of seemingly empty squares. However, don't be deceived, behind those "empty" squares lies the key to your salvation or perhaps, your doom! Will you dare to use your mouse to left click a square on the board? 
                
                First, start out by moving your mouse cursor over a square of your choosing. Do you feel the anticipation of what could possibly be hiding under that square?Me too. Be bold, don't switch squares now, just go with the first square that feels right.

                Next continue being bold by left clicking on that square.

                Woah, did you see what happened? Clicking that square revealed a bunch of cool stuff that was hiding under a bunch of those squares. 
                
                As you can see there are now a lot of empty dark grey squares. What this means is that there aren't any bombs in those square or any of the square adjacent to them. Now do you see the grey squares with numbers in them? Notice how they are next to squares that are still the original lighter color. Those numbers correspond to the number of bombs that are adjacent to that square, including neighbors that live catty-corner.
